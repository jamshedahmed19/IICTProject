                                        <p>Lassi is one of the most popular drinks in South Asia so it is no surprise that many Pakistani people enjoy it. It is mainly drunk after a heavy breakfast, whether it is halwa puri or naan chanay, lassi cannot be missed out. It is one of those drinks that can attract anyone. Lassi is made by blending together yoghurt, water, spices and sometimes fruit. Other ingredients are also added which is why there are many flavours like mango.But makkhaniya is one of the best ones as it is sweetened with sugar. For a richer texture, chunks of butter are added to it. This cold drink is best enjoyed during the summer. Every food corner that serves breakfast is likely to offer a large glass of sweet lassi.</p>

                                        <p>Shikanji is a traditional limeade or lemonade which originated in the Punjab region but its delicious taste meant that it made its way throughout Pakistan. It is made using lemon or lime juice, some ginger and sugar. The ingredients are mixed with cold water and served chilled. The cold drink is one of the most popular beverages to have during the summer. Not only will the sweet and slightly bitter taste quench the thirst but it has proven to be healthy. High in vitamin C, it stimulates your digestive system. Furthermore, lemons are an excellent example of an alkaline food that helps balance your body’s pH. Some may add a little salt or cumin for extra flavour but the overall taste makes it one of the most enjoyed drinks in Pakistan.</p>

                                        <p>Tea is one of the most popular drinks in Pakistan as it is drunk during almost every occasion, whether it be at work, at home or in restaurants. Tea, or chai, is served based on a person’s taste. Some like it strong while others may prefer it sweet. Sometimes people may choose to have it without milk or sugar. Even though there are many types of tea, one popular variant in Pakistan is noon chai, which has a distinctive pink colour. It tastes wonderful with or without sugar. It is served during winter and wedding events and a pinch of salt is added to it along with sugar. Karak chai is preferred by those working long shifts as it gives the drinker more of a caffeine boost than other tea.

                                        <p>Within South Asian dishes, a lot of milk, butter and sweeteners are used but when it comes to drinks, nothing can beat rabri doodh.

                                        <p>It is cold milk mixed with a fizzy drink like Sprite or Pakola, a line of carbonated drinks from Pakistan. It is then poured from glass to glass with ice, making it smoother and achieving a frothy consistency. The finished product is a drink with the creamy texture of milk but with the sweet flavour of the fizzy drink. It may sound like an unusual combination but in Pakistan, people consider it to be a healthier alternative than just fizzy drink. Doodh soda is also a refreshing counterpart to spicy food. Many of these drinks are popular in many areas of Pakistan with many people visiting vendors for an authentic taste of them.</p>
